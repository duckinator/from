# From

An ES6-inspired method for importing things from Ruby libraries.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'from'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install from

## Usage

`foo.rb`:

```ruby
module Foo
  module Bar
    # ...
  end

  module BAZ
    # ...
  end
end
```

`bar.rb`:

```ruby
bar, baz = from('foo').import(:Bar, :BAZ)

bar == Foo::Bar #=> true
baz == Foo::BAZ #=> true
```

`bar2.rb`:

```ruby
from('foo').include(:Bar, :BAZ)

Bar == Foo::Bar #=> true
BAZ == Foo::BAZ #=> true
```

## Limitations

Since `require`s are unscoped, this means it exposes the toplevel constant in a required file â€” as well as anything exposed by its dependencies. E.g., `from('net/socket').import(:TCP)` exposes `Net::Socket`.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
